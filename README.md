# StoryWeaver AI

This project is a Storyboard Generator app built using **Next.js** and **React**. It uses the **Hugging Face API** for text-to-image generation and the **Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview model** for segmenting a movie plot into distinct scenes. Each scene is summarized and an image is generated based on the scene description. The image is getting generated by **stable-diffusion-v1-5**. The app is designed to segment movie plots, generate related images, and display them dynamically.

## Features

- **Movie Plot Segmentation**: Breaks down a movie plot into individual scenes with summaries and sample dialogues.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Uses Hugging Face's API to generate images based on the scene summaries.
- **Sequential Image Generation**: Sequentially generates images for each scene based on the plot segmentation.
